  <h1>Proposal Overview</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Exploring flight delay patterns with a focus on post-COVID changes. Identifying key causes of delays (weather vs. controllable factors like staffing, maintenance, scheduling). Building machine learning models to predict both the likelihood and length of delays.</li>
    <li><strong>Research Questions:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Question 1: Has there been an increase in flight delays since COVID pandemic? Explore reasons for staff shortages, increase in travel or weather? (factors)</li>
        <li>Question 2: Can we predict flight delays?</li>
        <li>Question 3: Do certain airline companies have more flight delays?</li>
        <li>Question 4: Do certain airports have more flight delays?</li>
        <li>Question 5: Do current flights predict delays in a timely fashion how often?</li>
        <li>Question 6: What general variables are the most impactful in determining whether a flight will be delayed? (Between weather, staffing, mechanical, or other)</li>
        <li>Question 7: What specific variables are most informative on how long a flight will be delayed for?</li>
        <li>Question 8: How reliable can delay predictions be? Is there too much variability in records to be able to make good predictions?</li>
        <li>Question 9: Do flights to or from certain locations (east vs west coast, or down to airport precision) or at certain times (midnight vs midday) tend to be delayed more?</li>
        <li>Question 10: Can patterns between flight location/time and delays be explained in an actionable way, such that airport managers could work to improve the underlying problems?</li>
        <li>Question 11: How does the precision of a prediction change with the addition of more information? Are extra features impactful to a model, or are delays unpredictable beyond whether they will occur or not? For example: If a flight delay has been announced, how accurate would a prediction be solely based on that announcement compared to knowing that the delay was caused by weather?</li>
        <li>Question 12: How can delay predictions best be conveyed to commuters? Could there be a data visualization method that might be sub-optimal in a data science setting, but which would be more easily understandable to a layperson within an airport? (this one couldn't be purely supported by data so it might not be usable)</li>
