    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h2>Non-Technical Summary</h2>
         <p>The analysis of U.S. flight delays shows that delays became noticeably worse after the COVID-19 pandemic but 
           have slowly improved in recent years. The aviation system is stabilizing overall, but delays are still common 
           at certain airports and certain airlines. Busy travel periods such as summer and major holidays also continue to 
           contribute to delays. To better understand and predict delays, several machine learning approaches were tested 
           and provided different insights. The trend model confirmed that delays increased sharply right after COVID and 
           have gradually decreased over time. The decision tree model showed that using only basic pre-departure 
           information, such as airline, airport, and time of day, makes it possible to identify flights that will 
           depart on time in most cases. However it still remains very difficult to accurately identify the flights that 
           will end up delayed. The random forest model performed much better when predicting late-aircraft delays, 
           particularly when each departing flight was linked to the arrival of the same aircraft earlier in the day. 
           This reflects the real-world pattern that a late arrival often causes the next flight to depart late as well. 
           Clustering and association rule mining added further context by identifying groups of airlines and airports 
           with similar delay behaviors and revealing that delays are more common during certain times of day, such as
           evening hours.</p>

        <h2>Key Insights and Discoveries</h2>
             <p>Across all models, flight delays are partially predictable and highly context dependent. At the system level,
               linear regression showed a clear post-COVID spike in average monthly delays, followed by a gradual downward
               trend, suggesting the aviation system is still recovering but slowly stabilizing. At the individual flight 
               level, simple pre-departure information like carrier, airport, and scheduled time, were not enough to 
               reliably predict which flights would be delayed. The Decision Tree model mostly learned to identify on-time 
               flights and missed many true delays. However, when the problem was narrowed to late aircraft delays and 
               incorporated paired arrival–departure data and engineered features like scheduled turnaround time, 
               Random Forest models performed substantially better. Unsupervised methods added another layer of insight. 
               K-Means clustering revealed distinct groups of airlines and airports, separating relatively on-time operators
               from those with systematically higher delay rates, while Apriori rules confirmed that evening departures and 
               certain carrier–airport combinations are more delay prone than the baseline.</p>
    
        <h2>Explaination of Real-world Impact of Results</h2>
             <p>These findings can inform how airlines, airports, and even travelers think about delay risk. The post-COVID trend 
               analysis highlights that delays are not just random but follow structural patterns over time. This can support
               long-term planning around staffing, crew availability, and infrastructure. The late-aircraft models show that 
               propagation delays or in other words when one late flight causes another, are more predictable than generic delays.
               This suggests that airlines could use similar models to prioritize gate turns, add buffer time for at-risk 
               rotations, or proactively rebook passengers when an inbound flight is severely late. Clustering and 
               frequent-pattern mining provide practical guidance on where and when to expect trouble. The delay-prone airports,
               carriers, and evening time windows could be targeted for extra staffing or improved ground operations. Even if 
               perfect prediction is not always viable every delayed flight, these models highlight high-risk contexts where 
               interventions and communication are likely to mitigate delays.</p>

        <h2>Discussion of Limitations, Improvements, and Future Work</h2>
             <p>The analysis is constrained by several important limitations. This analysis worked with a restricted sample and did not 
               have real-time operational data such as detailed weather conditions, crew scheduling, or air-traffic control constraints.
               Additionally, the data is imbalanced with more on-time flights than delayed ones, hurting classification performance and 
               simple models overpredicting the majority class. Finally, interpretable baseline models like Decision Trees, Random Forests,
               K-Means, Apriori were mainly used and did not explore more complex architectures models. Future work could incorporate 
               external weather APIs and operational data as well as implement advanced models. Future work could also design user-facing
               visualizations or decision tools for airport personnel and travelers.</p>
