      <li><strong>Betsy Molgano</strong> – Data Lead</li>
    <li><strong>Bio</strong> – Betsy Molgano is the Program Director of the Mental Health First Aid Colorado program at the Colorado Behavioral Healthcare Council, and a 
      graduate student in a data science master’s program. Ms. Molgano graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a BA in Political Science in 2020 and moved 
      into an AmeriCorps service term that fall with the Aurora Public Defender’s Office. After completion of her term, she was able to gain the attention of the 
      Chief Executive Officer at the Colorado Behavioral Healthcare Council and joined the CBHC team in November of 2021 as a full-time policy intern. During this internship,
      she spent ten-months learning about the operations of CBHC and the broader community behavioral health system and the public policy landscape throughout Colorado. 
      In September of 2022, she became the Program Director, overseeing the statewide program and focusing on sustainability and expansion efforts. As the Program Director, 
      Betsy works with a statewide network of MHFA coordinators and instructors to support the delivery of the Mental Health First Aid. Currently she is pursuing a master’s 
      degree in data science as a way to braid her public policy knowledge with the power of data to be able to aid future advocacy efforts by using the power of big data to 
      tell compelling community stories.</li>
