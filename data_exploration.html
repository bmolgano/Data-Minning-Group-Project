    <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>Abstract: This project explores patterns and causes of flight delays in the United States using multiple government 
      and open data sources. The primary goal is to examine how flight delay trends have changed from pre-COVID (2019) 
      through post-COVID years (2022â€“2024), with a focus on specific airports and airlines. The analysis compares airport
      and airline specific performance, seasonal delay trends, and contributing factors such as weather and air-traffic 
      volume.</p>

    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Combined Dataset:</strong> 1,428 records across 21 variables covering Denver (DEN), LaGuardia (LGA), and Kansas City (MCI).</li>
      <li><strong>Normality Diagnostics:</strong> QQ plots revealed strong right skew in delay-related variables, suggesting log transformation.</li>
      <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Highly correlated variables (r > 0.9) were identified between flight counts and delay durations.</li>
      <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Features were standardized to mean = 0, std = 1 to prepare for modeling and clustering.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These insights guided our data preprocessing, normalization, and variable selection steps before moving to the modeling phase.</p>
