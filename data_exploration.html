    <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>Abstract: This project explores patterns and causes of flight delays in the United States using multiple government 
      and open data sources. The primary goal is to examine how flight delay trends have changed from pre-COVID (2019) 
      through post-COVID years (2022–2024), with a focus on specific airports and airlines. The analysis compares airport
      and airline specific performance, seasonal delay trends, and contributing factors such as weather and air-traffic 
      volume.</p>
    <h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
    <p>Data Collection: In order to collect our data for flight delay information, we used information from the Bureau of 
      Transportation Statistics (BTS). The data is directly from the government and monitors flight data for all years back 
      to 1987. Much of the data is aggregated by year or month which is good for data exploration and summary, but may not 
      be useful for predicting future flight delays. Thus we used the Detailed Statistics Departure which can generate 
      specific flight data for a given set of days. The tool can take up to 31 days of input for a given year, departure 
      airport and airline. It then outputs all the flights giving their takeoff, departure time, and any possible delays. 
      The data also give the reason for any delay and the time lost due to the delay.  As a result this dataset gave almost
      all answers to our research questions. It lets us analyze delay reasons, and we can make predictions using information
      such as takeoff time, departure airport, destination airport, airline company, and other factors covered in our 
      research questions. For now we did not have to aggregate any other data sources. However we did have to aggregate 
      the data from the tool using multiple queries. Since the tool can only give results for certain days for a certain 
      airline and airport we varied these factors to generate our initial data. We first chose 20 random days throughout 
      the year covering different months and different weekdays to capture a variety of flight data based on different 
      traffic patterns. .</p>
      <p>Data Source & Descriptions: Several data sources were evaluated for this project, each offering unique strengths and 
        limitations. The FAA Operations & Performance Data provides comprehensive historical traffic counts and delay statistics,
        making it a reliable source for analyzing U.S. air traffic performance, though access may require a Login.gov account and 
        could be impacted by federal transitions. The Operations Network (OPSNET) serves as the FAA’s official database for air 
        traffic operations since 1990, allowing for analysis of peak travel periods but lacking detail on delay causes and 
        flight level timing. FlightAware offers real-time and historical flight data across 45 countries but was excluded due to 
        its costly subscription requirements. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) provides public access to detailed 
        delay causes and trends, though it is limited by static downloads and the absence of real-time functionality. The OpenSky 
        Network delivers global flight tracking data useful for modeling and trend analysis but focuses more on aircraft movement 
        than airport-specific delays. The National Airspace System (NAS) Status site gives real-time insights into national 
        disruptions affecting air traffic, yet it lacks historical or flight-level data. Lastly, FlightLabs provides an API for 
        real-time flight information specific to airports like Denver International, but much of its data overlaps with other, 
        more comprehensive sources and was therefore not prioritized for this project.</p>
        <p>Method of Collection: Data were collected using publicly available API interfaces and query tools provided by the FAA 
          and BTS. For the BTS On-Time Performance dataset, a random sample of 24 total days (12th and 24th of each month in 2024)
          was selected to capture both peak travel days and regular operations. The dataset includes flight data collected from 
          four airports selected to represent a range of sizes and geographic regions. These airports are LaGuardia (LGA), a large 
          and high-density urban airport; Denver International (DEN), a major national hub; Kansas City International (MCI), a 
          mid-sized regional airport; and Chicago O’Hare (ORD), one of the nation’s largest and busiest hubs. Additionally, nine 
          major airlines such as American, Delta, Southwest, United, JetBlue, Spirit, Frontier, SkyWest, and Alaska were used in 
          this process. For each airport and airline combination, flight-level data were retrieved through the BTS query interface
          and exported as CSVs.</p>
     <p>Relevance to Research Questions: The datasets selected for this project are relevant to the research questions 
       because they capture the multiple dimensions of flight delays that influence air travel performance. The FAA’s 
       Operations & Performance Data and Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) provide historical and real-time 
       statistics on flight operations and delay patterns, making them essential for analyzing national trends and assessing 
       how delays have evolved since the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAA Operations Network (OPSNET) complements this by offering
       daily airport-level data, which supports temporal and seasonal analyses such as whether peak travel periods or higher 
       traffic volumes contribute to increased delays. FlightAware adds a valuable layer of real-time operational data 
       sourced from global air-navigation providers, allowing for cross-validation of FAA records and potential incorporation
       into short-term delay prediction efforts. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) dataset serves as the 
       project’s foundation for flight-specific delay analysis, offering detailed records on delay causes, airline 
       performance, and airport variation. The OpenSky Network expands this scope by providing high-frequency, real-time 
       flight-tracking data that can inform predictive modeling and spatial analysis of flight movements. Finally, the 
       National Airspace System (NAS) Status dashboard contributes contextual insight into system-wide events such as 
       facility outages or operational disruptions. Collectively, these datasets align closely with the project’s
       objectives to measure post-COVID delay trends, identify major contributing factors such as staffing, weather,
       or traffic volume, and evaluate the reliability and accuracy of current delay-prediction systems. </p>

   <h2>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>Handling Issues and Noise in the Data: Since the data was from the government and generated through a custom tool 
      there wasn’t much missing or incorrect data that we could identify.  However there was a slight issue with how total 
      delay times were presented. The dataset only presented departure delay and would not give direct information for in 
      flight delay. Instead for in flight information it would simply give expected time elapsed and actual time elapsed 
      for the journey. Thus we would often see delayed flights that would have a 0 in the departure delay column. To fix 
      this we added a new column for In flight delay that took the difference between expected and actual elapsed times.  
      Here we ran into some missing data as some of the elapsed time columns were 0. This may indicate that the flight was 
      cancelled or data was entered incorrectly. To fix this we simply set the In-flight delay column to 0. Total delay 
      was then computed by adding In flight delay and departure delay.For outliers, we generated a box plot for the merged
      34 datasets. According to the boxplot most of the delay times can be classified as outliers. However, it doesn’t make 
      sense to exclude so much data since in real life long flight delays can happen, and have a large effect on both
      companies and consumers. Thus we only excluded delay times above 1000 minutes for  delay analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to modifying values we also modified columns in order to better communicate flight delay information. 
  First the flight number and tail number columns were dropped as they provided unnecessary information. Next we looked 
  to clearly communicate the flight delay information. The dataset has 5 numerical columns for each type of delay. For 
  each entry the column is filled with the value in minutes that the particular delay was responsible for. This makes it 
  hard to analyze the reasons for delay immediately and we have to check all values for zeros to see if no delay occurred. 
  Thus three new columns were added to the dataset. A primary delay reason categorical column described the delay reason 
  that caused the largest percent of the total delay. If no delay occurred the column says no reason. Additionally, a 
  column for the total number of delay reasons, and primary reason delay percentage were also added. As mentioned above 
  some of the delays were due to In flight reasons that weren’t described by the data. So for these we simply put 
  “Unknown Reason” as the primary delay reason. This can help us easily do analysis for delay reasons and answer questions
  such as does weather cause more delays during winter months.</p>
                <figure>
    <img src="img/Boxplot for total delay time outliers.jpeg" 
         alt="Visualization: Boxplot for total delay time outliers" width="800">
                  
    <p>The categorical data such as destination airport, airline carrier and even textual data like dates can be left 
      untouched. It is possible that some other numerical attributes such as departure and arrival time could be modified 
      to be categorical with morning, night and day to help model understanding, but for now we left it numerical. 
      Computing basic statistical analysis for the delay time column did reveal some more cleaning that had to be done.
      First we noticed that analyzing delayed flights gave a minimum delay time below zero. This is because the dataset 
      does not account for arrival delay. So some flights with zero or negative departure delay can still be delayed 
      overall. To resolve this we added an arrival delay column and then a total delay column which added these two results.</p>
    
    <p>Understanding the Data: Two primary datasets from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) were used for this 
      analysis. The first dataset consists of monthly aggregated flight delay data for airports of varying sizes like large
      (LaGuardia, LGA), medium (Denver International, DEN), and small (Kansas City International, MCI). These datasets span
      three time periods from 2019 (pre-COVID), 2022 (post-COVID recovery), and 2024 (current). A total of nine datasets 
      were compiled, available below. A column definitions spreadsheet is also available below.</p>
    <p>A preliminary analysis of this aggregated data revealed that flight delays were slightly higher in 2022 across all 
      airports, likely reflecting post-pandemic operational challenges. The dataset is well-suited for cross-company and 
      cross-year comparisons, as it is aggregated by month and includes reasons for delays. However, its aggregation limits
      more granular analyses, such as day-of-week or time-of-day delay patterns, and it cannot be used directly for
      predictive modeling. To supplement this, an individual flight-level BTS dataset was collected from the On-Time 
      Performance database. This dataset provides detailed records of individual flights and delay causes, offering greater
      flexibility for exploratory analysis and modeling. Data were collected for four airports (LGA, DEN, MCI, and ORD) and
      nine airlines (American, Delta, Southwest, United, JetBlue, Spirit, Frontier, SkyWest, and Alaska). A random sampling
      strategy was used, selecting the 12th and 24th days of each month in 2024 to capture both regular and peak travel 
      periods. The final dataset includes 24 total days per airline and airport combination, providing balanced 
      representation across the calendar year. Some missing airline data were noted for smaller airports. The cleaned and 
      merged datasets are available below. Together, these datasets form a comprehensive foundation for comparing airport 
      operations and airline performance while allowing both macro- and micro-level analyses of flight delays.</p>
        
    <p>Basic Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis revealed strong positive relationships between multiple 
      delay-related variables, confirming internal consistency within the dataset. As shown in the correlation matrix, 
      arrival delay, carrier delay, NAS delay, and late aircraft delay are all highly correlated (r > 0.85), indicating 
      that disruptions in one delay category often coincide with others. This pattern suggests that flight delays tend to
      be multi-causal, with factors such as weather, air traffic management, and carrier logistics interacting rather than 
      acting independently. The heatmap also shows weaker or no correlation between temporal variables (e.g., month, year) 
      and operational delay metrics, implying that external conditions or airport-specific characteristics have a greater
      influence on performance than seasonal timing alone.</p>
    <p>Comparing average arrival delay by year and airport, Denver (DEN) and LaGuardia (LGA) consistently exhibited 
          higher total delay durations than Kansas City (MCI). The most significant spike occurred in 2022, where both major
          airports experienced noticeable increases in mean delay times, likely due to post-pandemic operational recovery 
          challenges such as staffing shortages and increased passenger volume. By 2024, delays showed signs of improvement
          and partial stabilization. Together, these patterns demonstrate that while national flight operations have become
          more stable, high-traffic airports continue to experience larger and more variable delays.</p>
    <p>Overall, the basic statistical analysis confirms that the dataset is both robust and suitable for deeper 
          exploration into flight delay trends. The data exhibit high internal consistency, with strong correlations
          among related delay variables such as arrival, carrier, and late aircraft delays, reinforcing the accuracy of 
          the reporting structure.</p>
    
     <p>Data Quality Assessment: The data retrieved from the BTS service is highly consistent and complete at a small 
          scale, but with one notable exception. The dataset used here is almost entirely empty between the times of 11pm 
          and 5am across all airports and years. This is not due to a failure in data collection; rather, flights are not 
          scheduled to depart at these times to avoid undue noise at night, as well as to offer a sort of "reset" to the 
          airport overnight. Interestingly, this lack of data is itself consistent and accurately depicts the state of 
          flights at these times. For this reason, this aspect of the dataset is not considered important to the questions 
          of completeness, consistency, or usability. A potentially large problem with the acquired data is the question of
          whether it is complete. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way of telling whether any flights have not been 
          recorded and placed into the BTS repository. There could be patterns that these missing data would reveal, such 
          as whether observations of certain airlines are frequently missing, incomplete, or otherwise unreliable. Despite 
          this, the BTS dataset offers a wide array of information in a niche where datasets are otherwise difficult to 
          come by. Thus, the question of completeness of the dataset is indeterminate. Outside of this concern, the 
          consistency and usability of the dataset rank highly.</p>
    <p>This dataset aligns nearly perfectly with the interests and questions of this project. The source of the dataset, 
      the BTS, is a reliable government resource which can be trusted, especially compared to any other source, to provide 
      raw data on the subject. The only limitation of this dataset, which is quite specific to this project, is the lack 
      of details on the causes of delays. In some cases, strong inferences must be made to determine the influences that 
      multiple delay-causing events may have on each delay time. However, this limitation must be accepted as there are no 
      better sources available for this research topic. In the future, additional dataset of relatively limited veracity 
      may be integrated in some capacity to offer more insights into delay causes, such as reports from airports on 
      employee counts during high-traffic times. One final consideration for this dataset is the minor ethical implication
      present. The data solely cover individual airplane flights, meaning no individuals are directly revealed. These data 
      could potentially be used to locate specific flights based on departure airports and times, but this exercise could 
      be undertaken regardless of the efforts of this project. Instead, the results found here and in future work in this 
      project will largely reduce the granularity of the dataset, further improving the privacy inherent in the original 
      data.</p>

      <p>Advanced Data Understanding: This stage focuses on exploring and refining the combined dataset to ensure it is 
        ready for modeling. It includes performing visual diagnostics such as QQ plots to assess normality, examining 
        correlations and relationships between variables, consolidating datasets where appropriate, and applying 
        normalization or transformation techniques to prepare the data for further analysis.</p>
      <p>The QQ plots show that most numerical variables deviate noticeably from the red reference line, confirming that 
        they are not normally distributed. The discrete variables, such as year and month, are naturally non-normal, while 
        continuous operational metrics like arr_flights, arr_del15, carrier_ct, and weather_ct display strong right skew. 
        This indicates that a few months had exceptionally high values compared to the majority. To address this skewness 
        and improve statistical assumptions for modeling, transformations such as logarithmic or Box-Cox may be applied to 
        stabilize variance and approximate normality.</p>
     <figure>
    <img src="img/QQ plots.jpeg" 
         alt="Visualization: QQ Plot" width="800">
   
      <p>The correlation heatmap reveals strong relationships among several variables, indicating patterns and possible 
        redundancy. Features such as arr_delay, arr_del15, and arr_flights are highly correlated (r ≈ 0.95), showing that
        greater flight volumes correspond to more delays. Late_aircraft_ct and late_aircraft_delay are almost perfectly 
        correlated (r ≈ 0.96), while carrier_ct and carrier_delay are also closely linked (r ≈ 0.92). Weather-related 
        variables show moderate correlations (r ≈ 0.65–0.75), whereas security-related factors are largely independent. 
        These strong interdependencies suggest potential multicollinearity, which should be mitigated by consolidating 
        redundant variables or applying dimensionality reduction methods like PCA.</p>

    <p><em>Description: This bar chart compares the percentage of delayed flights across nine major U.S. airlines using a 
      20-day flight sample from four airports (ORD, MCI, DEN, and LGA) in 2024. The results show that American Airlines 
      (28.5%), Frontier (28.4%), and JetBlue (27.7%) have the highest proportion of delayed flights, while SkyWest (18.5%),
      Delta (19.7%), and United (19.8%) perform better with fewer delays. This visualization suggests that airline company 
      characteristics such as operational scale, route networks, and scheduling practices may influence delay frequency,
      making carrier type an important variable in predictive delay analysis.</em> </p>

    <p><em>Description: This series of pie charts illustrates the distribution of flight delay causes across major U.S. 
      airlines, based on a 2024 dataset combining flights from four airports (ORD, MCI, DEN, and LGA). There is a large 
      percentage of  unknown delays and these may be hard to model since they can’t be predicted and usually happen in 
      flight. Outside of this across all carriers, the most frequent causes of delay are late-arriving aircraft, 
      carrier-related issues, and National Airspace System (NAS) factors, with weather and security delays representing a 
      much smaller share. Although proportions vary slightly by airline, a consistent pattern emerges. These findings 
      suggest that operational and scheduling factors internal to airlines have a stronger influence on delays than 
      external causes like weather.</em> </p>

      very long delays while the majority are clustered under 100 minutes. JetBlue and American Airlines display heavier 
      tails, suggesting greater variability and more extreme delay instances. By contrast, Southwest and Alaska Airlines 
      show narrower, more consistent delay ranges.</em> </p>

      , while Alaska and Southwest show the shortest averages (40–45 minutes). The smaller variance observed for these two 
      carriers may reflect more efficient operations or fewer long-haul delays. Together with the violin plot, this

      distribution of delay durations across the same airports. All distributions are right-skewed, with most flights delayed under
      100 minutes but a few extreme outliers exceeding 800 minutes. The similarity of these shapes suggests that while average

      measured in minutes since midnight. The chart reveals a clear gap in flight activity between roughly 11:00 p.m. and 
      5:00 a.m., reflecting the nationwide curfews implemented at most airports to reduce overnight noise and allow time 
      for maintenance and operational resets. Apart from this period, flight frequency increases steadily through the 
      morning and peaks during midday to early evening hours (approximately 600–1100 minutes, or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.), 
      aligning with typical passenger demand patterns. This visualization confirms that most flights are scheduled during
      normal waking and business hours, offering useful context for understanding when delays are most likely to occur.</em> </p>

    <p><em>Description: This scatterplot visualizes the relationship between scheduled departure times (in minutes since 
      midnight) and corresponding departure delay durations. The majority of data points cluster near or below zero, 
      indicating that most flights depart on time or with minimal delay. Delay density mirrors the daily scheduling pattern 
      observed in the previous histogram, with flights concentrated during midday and evening hours. A slight increase in 
      longer delays can be observed among flights departing around 1,200 minutes after midnight (approximately 8:00 p.m.), 
      suggesting that evening flights may face compounding operational delays from earlier in the day. However, this effect
      is modest and does not represent a strong or consistent trend. Overall, the visualization confirms that while delays 
      are slightly more common in the evening, flight performance remains generally consistent across the day.</em> </p>

    <p><em>Description: This bar chart illustrates the average flight delay duration by month, revealing clear seasonal 
      patterns. Delays peak during the summer months of May, June, and July, likely due to increased travel demand during
      the vacation season, leading to heavier air traffic and tighter scheduling. A secondary surge occurs during the winter
      months of December and January, which corresponds with the holiday travel period when flight volumes rise sharply over
      short time spans. These two peaks align closely with major U.S. travel seasons, suggesting that demand-related congest
      ion and weather factors jointly drive longer average delays. The visualization reinforces that temporal patterns are 
      an important contextual variable to consider when modeling or predicting flight delays.</em> </p>
