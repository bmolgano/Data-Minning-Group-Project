  <!-- Research Topic & Significance -->
  <h2>Research Topic & Significance</h2>
  <p>[Air travel plays a vital role in connecting people, businesses, and economies, yet one of its most persistent challenges is flight delays. Delays not only inconvenience passengers but also generate substantial financial costs for airlines and the broader economy. Our research topic will explore flight delays patterns with particular attention to changes since the COVID pandemic. We will analyze the reasons for flight delays and attempt to predict future flight delays using data-driven models. In general air transportation delays are costly to both consumers and airline companies. According to the estimation by the Total Delay Impact Study, transportation delays cost almost $32.9 billion in 2017. Since the COVID pandemic there has been a general increase in flight delays with a variety of underlying reasons.]</p>
